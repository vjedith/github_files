LINEAR FEEDBACK SHIFT REGISTER (LFSR)

ABOUT :

A LFSR or Linear Feedback Shift Register is a quick and easy way to generate pseudo-random data inside of an FPGA.  The LFSR can be used for things like counters, test patterns, scrambling of data, and others.  

The no. of random no. generated by a LFSR  is eqals to [(2^n)-1] , here “n” is no. of bits.


MODULE / CODE :

This module creates a n-bit LFSR (n=2,3,4,8,16) which means bit size can be mutable.

This project consist of 2 files :
1) top level module (LFSR_RTL.v)
2) test-bench (LFSR_TB.v)


SIMULATION :

The code can run in almost all the tools such as Xilinx Vivado, icarus Verilog & GTKWave , EDA playground etc.

Result will be viewed in follows :
1) RTL schematic (in vivado)
2) waveform 
3) log / command prompt 

(I have done it on EDA playground.....)
